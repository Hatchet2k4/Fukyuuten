The mildly dreadful Count Wenier waits patiently in his mangy hideout.  A scout comes barging in.

SCOUT: They have arrived!
WENIER: Who?  Who has arrived??
SCOUT: An army dressed in white!  They are demolishing our defenses!  There must be thousands of them!

Wenier gets up from his "throne" and steps down toward the scout.

WENIER: You fool!  That is no army...
ALL OF WENIER'S MEN: ?????
WENIER: It is but ONE MAN.
SCOUT: H-h-h-h-how coul that b-b-bee???
WENIER: It is Lord Stannon McMannon from the land of Briannon.  He's just moving really fast!!!

Wenier pulls out his "sword" and guts the scout.

WENIER: I'll give you the honor of dying by MY sword.  Du le Wenier le cunt un confronte cresante!

The scout falls to the ground...deader than a doornail.  An evil smirk develops on Wenier's face.  

WENIER: My regular army cannot withstand his might.  Only my Legions de Terreur will do!

Wenier pulls out a little "horn" and blows it.  A small handful of rough-looking men enter the room.

LEGIONS DE TERREUR: Sir!

Raising his evil eyebrow, he decides to rally them for his own amusement.

WENIER: Men!  I wish to find out which of you is the most ruthless and villianous among my clan!  So, I offer you a challenge!  There is a man outside.  A single man with the fury of a million armies!  To the one of you who brings me his testicules, I will offer you...this priceless hooker!

GIRL: I'm a pirate!

Wenier turns to the girl, who is in a cage, and yells!

WENIER: Shut up!  ...filthy female.  *ahem*  So go, my minons!  And claim his manhood for my glory!

Legeions de terreur exits the room.

WENIER: Death waits you, Lord Stannon... *evil laugh*
